		<h5>Email to send to Merchant:</h5>
		<p>Good day,</p>
		<p>I hope this email finds you well.</p>

<p>We have been contacted by (Buyer Name) regarding a reversal. For any reversals that need to be conducted you will need to email our support team on the merchantsupport@payfast.co.za address with the below information and we will conduct the reversal as long as there are sufficient funds in the PayFast accounts.</p>

<p>Buyers details:</p>
<p>Full name:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>Amount & date paid:</p>
<p>Amount to refund(full or partial):</p>
<p>Reason for the refund:</p>

<p>We will reverse funds to the same method of payment the client has made via our system.</p>

<p>Card reversals can take up to 7-10 working days to reflect back to the clients card and once supplied with banking details, EFT reversals can take up to 2 working days to reflect in their bank accounts.</p>

<p>Card reversals can only be conducted within 6 months of the initial payment. Where any errors are experienced with returning funds to a card, we will either request bank account details or have our finance team further assist with returning failed card payments should the buyer not have South African banking details.</p>

<p>I hope this provides some clarity on the matter.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact us should you have any further queries or concerns.</p>
